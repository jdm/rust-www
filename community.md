# Rust Community

Rust is an amazing programming language, but its greatest strength
is its kind and inclusive community.

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal
characteristic. Our [code of conduct][coc] sets the standards for
behavior in all official Rust forums, and is upheld by the
[moderation team][mod_team_email].

[coc]: https://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html

## TL;DR

The most important community resources for getting started with Rust are:

- The [#rust-beginners][beginners_irc] IRC channel, a very friendly channel that
  loves answering questions at any depth.
- The [users forum][users_forum] for asynchronous discussion about all
  things Rust.
- The [This Week in Rust][twir] newsletter, to keep up with what's
  happening in the community.

## News

[This Week in Rust][twir] collects the latest news, upcoming events
and a week-by-week account of changes in the Rust language and
libraries.

[The Rust Blog][rust_blog] is where the Rust team makes announcements
about major developments.

The Rust community has an [*unofficial* subreddit][reddit] where
virtually everything happening in the Rust community is discussed.
The forum abides by the [official code of conduct][reddit_coc].

We also have an official [Twitter][twitter] account.

## How to Get Help

### Moderation

[Rust Moderation Team][mod_team]

If you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable
by a community member, please [contact][mod_team_email] any of the
Rust moderation team immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor
or a newcomer, we care about making the community a safe space for
you.

### IRC Channels

Rustaceans maintain a number of friendly, high-traffic IRC channels.

The [#rust][rust_irc] channel on Moznet is a venue for general
discussion about Rust, and a good place to ask for help. You'll find
people willing to help you with any questions you may have, and
responses are typically very fast.

To get involved in the development of Rust itself, for anything about
contribution, or to find a mentor, [#rust-internals][internals_irc] is
the right channel.

There are also some more specific IRC channels
noted below.

#### Core channels

### Discussion Forums

We have two forums for asynchronous discussion:

- The [Users Forum][users_forum], a space for asking questions, posting code
  snippets, talking about Rust projects, and so on.

- The [Internals Forum][internals_forum], a space dedicated to design and
  implementation discussion about Rust itself (which includes Cargo, the
  standard library, and other core bits of infrastructure).

[users_forum]: https://users.rust-lang.org/
[internals_forum]: https://internals.rust-lang.org/

### Stack Overflow

[Stack Overflow][stack_overflow] is a question and answer site for programmers.
The Rust community is fairly active on the site, so searching for your problem
might reveal someone who has asked it before.

[stack_overflow]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust

## User Groups and Meetups

There are more than 50 [Rust User Groups][user_group] worldwide in over 20
countries totaling over 7,000 members. Rustaceans meet periodically in Rust User
Groups. Its a great introduction to the community and a great way to learn and
socialize with other people with a similar interest. Meetings are
usually held monthly and very informal. Meetings are open to everyone.

There's a global [calendar][calendar] for keeping up with Rust events.

## The Teams

Rust has a community-driven development process where most decisions are made
through open discussion and consensus, under the stewardship of various
[teams][teams]:

* The [Core Team][core_team] is responsible for steering the design and
development process, overseeing the introduction of new features, and ultimately
making decisions for which there is no consensus (this happens rarely).

* The [Language Design Team][language_team] is responsible for the
  design of new language features.

* The [Library Team][library_team] is responsible for the Rust standard
library, rust-lang crates, and conventions.

* The [Compiler Team][compiler_team] is responsible for compiler internals and
optimizations.

* The [Tooling and Infrastructure Team][tool_team] is responsible for official
tools like Cargo, multirust, rustfmt, as well as the CI Infrastructure for the
project.

* The [Community Team][community_team] is responsible for coordinating events,
outreach, commercial users, teaching materials, and exposure. They can also
direct inquiries to the correct parties when its not clear who to contact
about something Rusty.

* The [Moderation Team][mod_team] is responsible for helping to uphold the
[code of conduct][coc].

In addition to the official team rosters, most teams also have a larger set
of reviewers who are knowledgeable about the area and can sign off on
code. If you're interested in getting involved in one of these teams,
feel free to reach out to the team leader or any other member, who can
help get you started.

If you are not sure where to direct an enquiry, the best starting point
would be the [community team][community_team].

## Rust Development

Rust has had over [1,200 different contributors][authors], a number that grows
every single week. We'd love for you to join that list! If you aren't sure what
to work on or how to get started, take a look at our
[how to contribute][contribute] page.

As mentioned above, the [Rust Internals Forum][internals_forum] is dedicated to
discussing the design and implementation of Rust. A lot of discussion also
happens on Github:

- The [main repository][github] and [issue tracker][issue_tracking] are the
  front lines of the implementation work. Our reviewers strive to be friendly
  and to help mentor newcomers, so don't hesitate to open a pull request!

- The [RFC repo][rfcs] tracks our Request for Comment process, the main pathway
  through which the Rust community and the teams reach consensus on new
  features proposed for the language and official libraries and tools.

Roughly weekly, the Rust teams produce [team reports][team_reports] tracking
team business, including the progression of proposals through the RFC and
implementation process.
